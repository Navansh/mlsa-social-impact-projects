## Introduction

The MLSA Blogs Project aims to provide a platform where MLSAs can contribute blog posts on various topics related to technology, programming, and innovation. This repository serves as the foundation for the web application that showcases these blogs, fostering knowledge-sharing and community collaboration.

## Features

- **Blog Submission:** MLSAs can submit their technical blog posts on a wide range of subjects, from coding tutorials to industry insights.
- **Categorized Posts:** Blogs are organized into categories for easy navigation, making it simple for readers to find content relevant to their interests.
- **Simple yet Dynamic Way of Writing : ** Blogs are written in such a manner, that the person with the least amount of technical knowledge can grasp at least the vibe of the blog.
